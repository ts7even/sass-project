# SASS Project
Click on main.py for the code and copy/paste  

Here is the SASS Assignment for class that I made. Even though it is pretty basic python, I think you can learn some of python's systax and the pandas library. 
- The problem is that for the Teachers Age, I'm trying to figure out the average or mean of the funciton. Since it is a Range. 
- Another problem is that I might be using the Private Schools csv for the data.

# To Git Pull into Folder 
- Make sure to pull before createing a virtual enviorment. Or be CD into the main folder 
git init 

git pull https://github.com/ts7even/sass-project.git


# Venv conflict
- Make sure your are in your virtual enviorment before pushing to github or else your path breaks.

# Steps I took 
create folder 

open folder in vscode 

create main.py file 

open terminal and create venv

add python libraires (pandas, openpyxl, bs4, matplotlib)

create source folder

inside of sources create dataset folder 

place datasheet into dataset folder

# Error Finding Datasheet
- You need to save all and restart you computer for python to find the enviorment
I found that shutting off and turning back off works better.
